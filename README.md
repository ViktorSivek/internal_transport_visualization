# internal_transport_visualization
My semestral work in the Business intelligence seminar. Power Bi visualization of internal transport for an imaginary company.

We got assigned data of the imaginary company for example regions and goods etc. I had to do visualization of transport options of that company.

I calculated avarage costs of various goods tranport to various locations. As well as cost of one tonne per one kilometre of transport.
